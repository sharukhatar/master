iSCSIâ€”The IPS module provides IP hosts access to Fibre Channel storage devices. The IP host
sends SCSI commands encapsulated in iSCSI protocol data units (PDUs) to a Cisco MDS 9000
Family switch IPS port over a TCP/IP connection. At this point, the commands are routed from an
IP network into a Fibre Channel network and forwarded to the intended target. Figure 37-2 depicts
the iSCSI scenarios in which the IPS module is used.
